# Graph Algorithms
<h2>Purpose</h2>
I wrote implementations of these graph algorithms and performed some tasks on them to better undestand how it work. </br>
Graph theory is one of the fundamental concepts in Computer Science. 
Graph abstraction is a powerful problem-solving tool used for
describing relationships between discrete objects.
